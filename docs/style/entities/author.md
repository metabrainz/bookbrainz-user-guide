# Author

An author is a person or group who have contributed creatively to a work, edition or edition group.

## Naming

The name of an author should their canonical name in its original language and script. A canonical name is the name that is most commonly used, i.e. their best-known name. Additional names, including legal name, pseudonyms, alternate spellings, transliterations, etc. should be included as aliases.

### Languages

Author names can be expressed in multiple languages; a name can be adapted to different names in other languages without retaining the same pronunciation. Examples:

- Αἴσωπος ← *name in original Greek*
- Aesop ← *name in English*
- Ésope ← *name in French*
- 伊索 ← *name in Chinese*

When entering a name in a different language as an alias, specify the corresponding language of its usage.

### Transliteration

Transliteration is the representation of a name in a different script, intending to maintain its pronounciation. Example:

- Αἴσωπος ← *name in original Greek*
- Aísōpos ← *transliterated into Latin script*

When entering a transliterated name as an alias, specify the original language of the name.

## Groups

A group author represents a named group of individuals (e.g. an organization, partnership, collaboration, etc.) that creates a work, edition or edition group. Examples:

- [Brüder Grimm](https://bookbrainz.org/author/c99f205e-75ea-4b6a-bbc5-5eb1c8533116), aka the Brothers Grimm
- [Lewis Padgett](https://bookbrainz.org/author/fddd338b-b0c6-412e-a5df-7679393dc18f), pen name of collaborators Henry Huttner and C. L. Moore
- [Franklin W. Dixon](https://bookbrainz.org/author/b9d5cf85-654e-4225-a6ed-3db99a72c857), pen name used by a variety of authors

Where practical, a group should have relationships to individual authors who participated as members in the group.

Publishers are *not* classified as group authors, as the act of publishing is not considered the act of creative contribution to a work, edition or edition group.

## Special-purpose authors

Special-purpose authors handle situations where the actual author(s) of works, editions or edition groups cannot be represented. Examples:

- [[anonymous]](https://bookbrainz.org/author/fd47e471-a994-4ed9-bf52-531d5f184dd3) is used when an author has published a work anonymously, or author attribution has been irrecoverably lost.
- [[unknown]](https://bookbrainz.org/author/6c1b8f55-4c7e-4739-bfa2-1979da4c68e1) is used when the author is currently unknown, but could potentially be determined at a later time.
- [[traditional]](https://beta.bookbrainz.org/author/415a1f7c-a793-4107-9f2f-c38caf15116d) is used for works that have been preserved in the oral tradition (e.g. received, preserved, and transmitted orally from one generation to another).
