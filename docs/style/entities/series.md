# Series

[TOC]

## What are Series?
explain what series are used for

## Different types of series
We don't actually have "series types" other than "whatever sort of type it's a series of" so author, edition, etc" we don't have "awards" "world" (as in same tematic world) etcetera.

This requires more discussion on community, figuring out things, etc.


## How do I create a Series?

(Insert details here)

## When should I create a new Series?
When to use series and when to use edition groups
(omnibus vs. "box sets" vs. collective works etc)
e.g. what about things that are released as separate parts and then put into a big book later?
Like, Sherlock Holmes was released as articles in a magazine, then later as books and later still in omnibus "all works by" type bricks.
same with most manga, sections are first released as chapters in serial magazines, and *then* later in full tankubon.
ditto Tolkien. noone in their right mind would released "The Return of the King" as a standalone book today, but it was still released as such originally. 

Finally MAGAZINES and newspapers and articles. how to deal with a release where it contains potentially hundreds of "works" that could themselves be potentially re-released in other formats and orders. reference books, how to deal with a book that is essentially a selection of excerpts of a lot of different people's writings from other, older sources.

## Linking Series to other entities

### Link to other Series
- sub series

### Link to Author
- awards

### Link to Edition
This is intended for editorial collections, a set of books published by the same publisher/imprint, usually written by various authors, each book with its own title, but all grouped under the same collective title. The collective title is the title of the collection, it must be mentioned on each book.

Some [examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Editorial_collections):
- [Penguin Popular Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Popular_Classics), paperback reprints of a previous editorial series
- [Bibliothèque de la Pléiade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_de_la_Pl%C3%A9iade)
- [For Dummies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Dummies)


### Link to Work
- is part of series
    - "set in the same world as" vs "intended to be in the same series" (what ED-work is for)
- inspired series

### Link to Edition Group
We do not create relationships to Edition Groups. For more information see the [Edition Group page](./edition-group.md#linking-edition-groups-to-other-entities)
